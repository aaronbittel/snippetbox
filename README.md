# Snippetbox

This project is part of my journey through the programming book [*Let's Go*](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) by Alex Edwards.  
I'm building a **snippetbox** web application while documenting all my learnings and insights along the way.

## What is Snippetbox?

Snippetbox is a simple web application for managing text snippets. It serves as a practical exercise to learn and apply Go programming concepts, including:

- Building web servers in Go.
- Handling routing and middleware.
- Interacting with databases.
- Writing clean, maintainable code.

## Goals

1. Develop a solid understanding of Go's core web development tools.
2. Learn by implementing a real-world application.
3. Document key concepts and challenges as I progress.
